<h2><a name="basicconcepts">Basic Concepts</a></h2>

The terminology to describe <tt>unpaper</tt> makes heavy use of the
paper metaphor, because the software is mainly intended for post-processing
scanned images from printed paper documents. <br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="sheetsandpages"></a>Sheets and Pages</h3>

The very basic object <tt>unpaper</tt> operates on is a <i><b>sheet</b></i>.
A <i>sheet</i> is an initially blank image in the computer's memory. Think of a <i>sheet</i>
as an initially empty piece of paper on which something will be printed later.<br>
<br>
To do something useful with a <i>sheet</i>, you will at least want to
place one <b><i>page</i></b> onto a <i>sheet</i>. A <i>page</i> is a
logical unit of a document which takes up a rectangular area on a <i>sheet</i>.
In the most simple case, one <i>sheet</i> carries exactly one <i>page</i>,&nbsp;
in other cases (e.g. when using a double-page <i>layout</i>) there can be
multiple <i>pages</i> placed on one <i>sheet</i>.<br>
<br>

<small>Figure 1: Sheets and Pages</small><br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="imagefiles"></a>Input and Output Image Files</h3>

<tt>unpaper</tt>
can process either double-page <i>layout</i> scans or individually scanned
<i>pages</i>. It is up to the user's choice whether an <b><i>image-file</i></b>
carries a single <i>page</i> or a whole <i>sheet</i> with two <i>pages</i>.
The program can be configured to either join individual <i>image-files</i>
as multiple <i>pages</i> onto one <i>sheet</i>, or split <i>sheets</i>
containing multiple <i>pages</i> into several output <i>image-files</i>
when saving the output.<br>
<br>
By default, <tt>unpaper</tt> places one input <i>image-file</i> onto
a <i>sheet</i>, and saves one output <i>image-file</i> per <i>sheet</i>.
Alternatively, the number of input or output <i>image-files</i> per <i>sheet</i>
can be set to two using the <b><tt>--input-pages</tt><tt> 2</tt></b> or 
<b><tt>--output-pages 2</tt></b> options.<br>
<br>
If two <i>image-files</i>
are specified as input, they will successively be placed on the
left-hand half and the right-hand half of the <i>sheet</i>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/input-pages.png"><br>
<small>Figure 2: Input Files<br>
</small><br>
In the same way, if two <i>image-files</i>
are specified as output, the <i>sheet</i> will be split into two halves
which get saved as individual files.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/output-pages.png"><br>
<small>Figure 3: Output Files<br>
</small><br>
The default value both for <tt>--input-pages</tt> and <tt>--output-pages</tt>
is 1.<br>

<h4><span class="mozTocH4"></span>File Formats</h4>
The <i>image-file</i> formats accepted by <tt>unpaper</tt> are those
of the PNM-family: <b>PBM</b>, <b>PGM</b> and <b>PPM</b>. This
ensures interoperability with
the <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/">SANE</a> tools under Linux.
The simplicity of the PNM file-formats also
allows <tt>unpaper</tt> to be developed as a
pure standalone program without any dependencies on external packages
or libraries, because the PNM file-formats are very easy to handle.<br>
<br>
In order to operate on images with a different file-format, several
image file-format converters are available which
can be used to convert to PNM before processing,
and afterwards convert back from PNM to the desired file format. Look
e.g. at <tt>pngtopnm</tt> <tt>/</tt> <tt>pnmtopng</tt>, <tt>tifftopnm</tt>
<tt>/</tt> <tt>pnmtotiff</tt>, <tt>jpegtopnm</tt> <tt>/</tt> <tt>pnmtojpeg</tt>,
or
consider using the all-purpose image file-type converter <tt>convert</tt>
from the <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">imagemagick</a> package.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="layoutsandtemplates"></a>Layouts and Templates</h3>

<h4>Built-In Layout-Templates</h4>
<b><i>Layouts</i></b> are the linking concept between physical <i>sheets</i>
and logical <i>pages</i>. A <i>layout</i> determines a set of
rectangular areas at which <i>pages</i> (or other parts of content)
appear on a <i>sheet</i>. The most common and simple <i>layouts</i>
generally used are the single-page <i>layout</i> (one <i>page</i>
covers the whole <i>sheet</i>), and
the double-page <i>layout</i> (two <i>pages</i> are placed on the
left-hand-side and the right-hand-side of the <i>sheet</i>).<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper</tt> provides basic <b><i>layout </i><i>templates</i></b> for
the above types<i>. There are 2 <i>layout</i> <i>templates</i>
built in, a third one deactivates any template:<br>
<ol>
  <li><tt>single</tt></li>
  <li><tt>double</tt></li>
  <li><tt>none</tt><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<img alt="" src="img/layout-templates.png"><br>
<small>Figure 6: Available Layout Templates</small><br>
<br>
A <i>layout template</i> is chosen by using the option <b><tt>--layout</tt></b>,
e.g. <br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper --layout double input%03d.pbm output%03d.pbm</tt>. <br>
<br>
Choosing a <i>template</i> with the <tt>--layout</tt>
option is equivalent to specifying a set of other options, e.g.
setting <tt>--mask-scan-point</tt>.
In order to combine a <i>template</i> with other options,
make sure that the more specific options appear behind the <tt>--layout</tt>
option, in order to overwrite the <i>template</i> settings.<br>
<br>
The default template is <tt>single</tt>, use <tt>none</tt> to deactivate this.<br>
<br>
<i>Note:</i> A <i>layout</i> is completely independent from the number
of<i> image-files</i> used as input or output. That means, you can either specify
<tt>--layout double</tt> together with a single input <i>image-file</i>
(in cases where the input <i>image-file</i> already contains two scanned <i>pages</i>
in a double-page <i>layout</i>), or use it together with an <tt>--input-pages
2</tt> setting, in order to join two individually scanned <i>pages</i>
on one <i>sheet</i>.<br>

<h4>Complex Layouts<br></h4>
Besides the built-in fixed <i>templates</i>, any kind of complex <i>layout</i>
can be handled by manually specifying either <i>mask-scan-points</i>
using the <b><tt>--mask-scan-point</tt></b> option, or setting <i>masks</i> at
fixed coordinates using the <b><tt>--mask</tt></b> option. Both the <tt>--mask-scan-point</tt>
and the <tt>--mask</tt> option may occur any number of times, in order
to declare as many <i>masks</i> in the <i>layout</i> as desired. See below for
a further explanation on <i>masks</i>.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="multiplefiles"></a>Processing Multiple Files</h3>

In many cases, especially when post-processing scanned books, there
will be several input <i>image-files</i> to process in sequence within
a single run of <tt>unpaper</tt>, and several output <i>image-files</i> to be generated.
Processing of multiple files in a batch job is supported through the
use of wildcards in filenames, e.g.:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper (...options...) input%03d.pbm output%03.pbm</tt><br>
<br>
This will successively read
images from files <tt>input001.pbm</tt>, <tt>input002.pbm</tt>, <tt>input003.pbm</tt>
etc., and write output to the files <tt>output001.pbm</tt>,
<tt>output002.pbm</tt>, <tt>output003.pbm</tt> etc., until no more
input <i>image-files</i> with the current index number are available.<br>
<br>
Using a wildcard of the form "%0<i>n</i>d" will replace each occurrence
of the wildcard with an increasing index number, by default
starting with 1 and counting up by 1 each time another files gets loaded. <i>n</i>
denotes the number of digits that the replaced number string is
supposed to have, and the <i>0</i> requests leading zeros. Thus "%03d"
will get replaced with strings in the sequence <tt>001</tt>, <tt>002</tt>,
<tt>003</tt> etc. This way, a sequence of images named e.g. <tt>input001.pgm</tt>,
<tt>input002.pgm</tt>, <tt>input003.pgm</tt>... can be specified.
There are two seperate index counters for input and output files which
get increased independently from each other.<br>
<br>
Wildcards in filenames are also useful when combining a sequence
of individual <i>pages</i> onto double-page layouted <i>sheets</i>,
or when splitting double-page layouted <i>sheets</i> into individual
output files. When using two input or output <i>image-files</i> (by
specifying <tt>--input-pages 2</tt> or <tt>--output-pages 2</tt>) the
index number replaced for the wildcard
will generally not be the same as the <i>sheet</i> number in the
processing sequence, but will grow twice as fast. <br>
<br>
The following example will combine
single-page <i>image-files</i> onto a double-page <i>layout</i> <i>sheet</i>:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper -n --input-pages 2 singlepage%03d.pgm output%03d.pgm<br>
</tt><br>
This joins the input images <tt>singlepage001.pgm</tt> and <tt>singlepage002.pgm</tt>
on<tt> output001.pgm</tt>, <tt>singlepage003.pgm</tt> and <tt>singlepage004.pgm</tt>
on <tt>output002.pgm</tt>, and so on. Note that due to the use of
option <tt>-n</tt> (short for <tt>--no-processing</tt>), the
images are simply copied onto the left-hand half and the right-hand half of the <i>sheet</i>
without any processing regarding <i>layout</i>, <i>mask-detection</i>
etc.<br>
<br>
Using
multiple input <i>image-files</i> by setting <tt>--input-pages 2</tt>
is
independent from any <i>layout</i> possibly specified with the <tt>--layout</tt>
option. However, in order to use <tt>unpaper</tt>'s post-processing
features for more than simply joining two <i>image-files</i> to one,
you will
most likely want to combine the use of <tt>--input-pages 2</tt> with
the <tt>--layout double</tt> option, as in:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper --layout double</tt><tt> </tt><tt>--input-pages 2 (...other options...) singlepage%03d.pgm output%03d.pgm</tt><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/multiple-input-files.png"><br>
<small>Figure 4: Sequence of multiple input images</small><br>
<br>
Similarly, it is also possible to split up a <i>sheet</i> into
several <i>image-files</i> when saving. The following line would be
used to split up a sequence of double-page layouted <i>sheets</i> into a sequence of
single-page output images, including full image processing (applying <i>masking</i>,
<i>deskewing</i>, <i>border-aligning</i> etc., see below) in
order to make sure that the <i>pages</i> in the double-page <i>layout</i>
are really placed fully on the left-hand half and the right-hand half of the <i>sheet</i>
before the <i>sheet</i> gets split up:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper --layout double (...options...) --output-pages 2 doublepage%03d.pgm singlepage%03d.pgm</tt><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/multiple-output-files.png"><br>
<small>Figure 5: Sequence of multiple output images</small><br>
<br>
By default, processing of multiple <i>sheets</i> starts with <i>sheet</i>
number 1, and also with input&nbsp;and output <i>image-files</i> number
1. <tt>unpaper</tt> will run as long as input <i>image-files</i> with the current index
number can be found. If no more input files are available, processing stops.<br>

<h4>Adjusting Indices</h4>
In order to start with a different <i>sheet</i> index, the <b><tt>--start-sheet</tt></b>
option can be set. Likewise, setting <b><tt>--end-sheet</tt></b>
specifies a fix <i>sheet</i> number that will the last one
processed, even if more input-files are available.<br>
<br>
Using <b><tt>--sheet</tt></b>, a single <i>sheet</i> or a set of specific
<i>sheet</i> numbers to be processed can be specified. For example: <br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper --sheet 7,12-15,31 --input-pages 2 (...options...) input%03d.pgm output%03d.pgm</tt><br>
<br>
This would generate the output-files <tt>output007.pgm</tt>, <tt>output012.pgm</tt>,
<tt>output013.pgm</tt>, <tt>output014.pgm</tt>, <tt>output015.pgm</tt>
and <tt>output031.pgm</tt>, reading input from the same files as if a
whole sequence of <i>sheets</i> and <i>pages</i> starting with index 1 had been
processed, i.e. reading the files <tt>input013.pgm</tt> and <tt>input014.pgm</tt>
for <i>sheet</i> 7, <tt>input023.pgm</tt> and <tt>input024.pgm</tt>
for <i>sheet</i> 12, and so on.<br>
<br>
To prevent some <i>sheets</i> from being processed (i.e., remove them
from the sequence), the option <b><tt>--exclude</tt></b>
can be used. Note that this is different from option <tt>--no-processing</tt>
or <tt>-n</tt>, which still would generate the output files but
without applying any image processing to them.<br>
<br>
The input and output index numbers to start with can be adjusted using
the options <b><tt>--start-input</tt></b> and <b><tt>--start-output</tt></b>.
These values apply to the wildcard replacement in filenames only and
are independent from the <i>sheet</i> numbering. In other words,
setting these options specifies an offset at which the file numbering starts relative
to <i>sheet</i> 1. For example:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper </tt><tt>--input-pages 2 (...options...) --start-input 7 input%03d.pgm output%03d.pgm</tt><br>
<br>
These settings would cause the input-files <tt>input007.pgm</tt> and <tt>input008.pgm</tt>
to be used for <i>sheet</i> 1, <tt>input009.pgm</tt> and <tt>input010.pgm</tt>
for <i>sheet</i> 2, and so on. The default value for both options is 1.<br>

<h4>File-Sequence Patterns<br></h4>
More sophisticated <b><i>file-sequence patterns</i></b> can be
specified using the <b><tt>--input-file-sequence</tt></b>
or <b><tt>--output-file-sequence</tt></b> options. In cases where the
input files are named after a pattern like e.g. <tt>left01.pbm</tt>, <tt>right01.pbm</tt>,
<tt>left02.pbm</tt>, <tt>right02.pbm</tt> etc., the use of <tt>--input-pages 2</tt> together with <tt>--input-file-sequence left%02d.pbm right%02d.pbm</tt>
will load to the desired images. The index counter with which the
wildcards in the filenames get replaced is increased every time the
<i>file-sequence pattern</i> is iterated through, it will not be
increased after each single replacement of a wildcard.<br>
<br>
Note that it would also be possible to use
<i>file-sequence patterns</i> of
different lengths than the number of <i>pages</i> per <i>sheet</i>.
In case an input <i>file-sequence</i> like e.g. <tt>a%d.pbm b%d.pbm c%d.pbm</tt>
is specified together with <tt>--input-pages
2</tt>, the input <i>image-files</i> used for the first <i>sheet</i>
would be <tt>a1.pbm</tt>
and <tt>b1.pbm</tt>, the input <i>image-files</i> used for the second
<i>sheet</i> would be <tt>c1.pbm</tt>
and <tt>a2.pbm</tt> (!), for the third <i>sheet</i> they would be <tt>b2.pbm</tt>
and <tt>c2.pbm</tt>, and so on. It's up to the user whether it makes sense to use
<i>file-sequence patterns</i> of different length than the corresponding number of
input <i>image-files</i> or output <i>image-files</i> per <i>sheet</i>.<br>
<br>
Specifying a filename as the very last argument on the command-line is
equivalent to using <tt>--output-file-sequence &lt;file&gt;</tt>
(a sequence of length 1), specifying a filename as the last-but-one
argument on the command line is equivalent to using <tt>--input-file-sequence
&lt;file&gt;</tt>.<br>

<h4>Inserting Blank Content</h4>
Input <i>file-sequences</i> may be forced to use completely blank images at
some index positions. The <b><tt>--insert-blank</tt></b> option allows to specify one or more input
indices at which no file is read, but instead a blank image is inserted
into the sequence of input images. The input image that would have been
loaded at this index position in the sequence will be used at the
following non-blank index posisiton instead, thus the following indices
get shifted to make room for the blank image inserted.<br>
<br>
The <b><tt>--replace-blank</tt></b> option also allows to insert blank
images into the sequence, but it suppresses the images that would have
been loaded at the specified index positions and ignores them. No
index positions get shifted to make room for the blank image.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="masks"></a>Masks<br></h3>

<b><i>Masks</i></b> are rectangular areas on a <i>sheet</i> that are
affected by several of the processing steps <tt>unpaper</tt> performs.
Although there may be as many <i>masks</i>
on a <i>sheet</i> as desired, in most cases it will be useful to
operate with either one or two <i>masks</i> per <i>sheet</i> only. A
single-page <i>layout</i> would operate on only one <i>mask</i> covering the whole
<i>page</i>, a double-page <i>layout</i> would make use of two <i>masks</i>, one placed
somewhere in the left-hand half of a <i>sheet</i>, the other somewhere in the
right-hand half.<br>

<h4>Automatic Mask-Detection</h4>
<i>Masks</i> can be set directly by specifying pixel coordinates
using the <tt>--mask</tt> option, but in most cases it is desirable to
detect <i>masks</i> automatically. Automatic <b><i>mask-detection</i></b>
allows input images to contain content which is not perfectly placed at fix
areas, but probably differs slightly in position from <i>sheet</i> to <i>sheet</i>
(which is usually the case when books are scanned or photocopied manually).<br>
<br>
Automatic <i>mask-detection</i> uses a starting point somewhere on the
<i>sheet</i> called <b><i>mask-scan-point</i></b>, which marks a
position estimated to be somewhere inside the <i>mask</i> to be detected. (When detecting
<i>masks</i> that cover a whole <i>page</i>, it is useful to place the <i>mask-scan-point</i>
right in the center of the <i>sheet</i>'s half on which the <i>page</i>
appears.) Beginning from the <i>mask-scan-point</i>, the image content is
virtually scanned in either the two horizontal directions (left and
right), or the two vertical directions (up and down), or all four directions, until no
more dark pixels are found which means an edge of the <i>mask</i> is
considered to have been found.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/mask-scan.png"><br>
<small>Figure 7: Mask-Detection</small><br>
<br>
Several parameters control the process of <i>mask-detection</i>. At
first, <i>mask-scan-points</i> to start detection at get specified
either using the <tt>--layout</tt>
option (which automatically sets one <i>mask-scan-point</i> for single-page
<i>layouts</i>, and two <i>mask-scan-points</i> for double-page <i>layouts</i>)
or manually with the option <b><tt>--mask-scan-point</tt></b>.<br>
<br>
<i>Mask-detection</i> is performed by the use of a 'virtual bar' which
covers an area of the <i>sheet</i> under which the number of dark pixels is
counted.<br>
The 'virtual bar' is moved towards the directions
specified by <b><tt>--mask-scan-direction</tt></b>.
(Those directions not given via <tt>--mask-scan-direction</tt> will
use up the whole <i>sheet</i>'s size in these directions for the
detected result.)<br>
<br>
While moving the 'virtual bar' the number of
dark pixels below it is continually compared to the number that has
been counted at the very first position of the 'virtual bar' above the <i>mask-scan-point</i>
when detection started. Once the number of dark pixels drops below the
relative value given by <b><tt>--mask-scan-threshold</tt></b>,
<i>mask-detection</i> stops and an edge of the <i>mask</i> is
considered to have been found.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/mask-scan-detail1.png"><br>
<small>Figure 8: 'Virtual Bar' for Mask-Detection</small><br>
<br>
The width of the 'virtual bar' can be configured using the <b><tt>--mask-scan-size</tt></b>
option, the length of it by setting <b><tt>--mask-scan-depth</tt></b>.
Adjusting the 'virtual bar's' width can help to fine-tune the process
of mask detection according to the content that is being scanned. The
wider the 'virtual bar' is, the more tolerant the detection process
becomes with respect to small gaps in the content (which is e.g. needed
if a <i>page</i> is made up of multiple columns). However, if the
'virtual bar' is too wide, detection might not stop properly when a
mask's edge should have been found.<br>
<img alt="" src="img/mask-scan-detail2.png"><br>
<small>Figure 9: Mask-Scan-Threshold</small><br>
<br>
<i>Mask-detection</i> can be disabled using the <b><tt>--no-mask-scan</tt></b>
option, optionally followed by the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter
for.

<h4>Mask-Centering</h4>
<i>Masks</i> that have been automatically detected or manually set will
be used for several
further processing steps. At first they provide the basis
for properly centering the content on the corresponding <i>page</i>
area on the <i>sheet</i>.<br>
<br>
This allows <tt>unpaper</tt> to automatically
correct imprecise positions of <i>page</i> content in scanned <i>sheets</i>
and shift the content to a normalized position. Especially
when processing multiple <i>pages</i>, this leads to more regular
positions of <i>pages</i> in the sequence of resulting <i>sheets</i>.<br>
<img alt="" src="img/mask-center.png"><br>
<small>Figure 10: Mask-Centering</small><br>
<br>
<i>Mask-centering</i> can be suppressed using <b><tt>--no-mask-center</tt></b>,
optionally followed by the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter for.

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="borders"></a>Borders</h3>

Unlike <i>masks</i>, <b><i>borders</i></b> are detected by starting
at the outer edges of the <i>sheet</i>
(or left/right halfs of the <i>sheet</i>, in a double-page <i>layout</i>),
and then scanning towards the middle until
some content-pixels are reached. Again, a 'virtual bar' is used for
detection, the width of which can be set using the option <b><tt>--border-scan-size</tt></b>,
and the step-distance with which to move it by setting the option
<b><tt>--border-scan-step</tt></b>. The option
<b><tt>--border-scan-threshold</tt></b> determines the maximum absolute
number of pixels which are tolerated to be found below the 'virtual
bar' until <i>border-detection</i> stops and one edge of the <i>border</i>
area is considered to have been found.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/border-scan.png"><br>
<small>Figure 11: Border-Detection</small><br>

<h4>Border-Aligning</h4>
<i>Borders</i> serve two different purposes: First, the area outside
the detected <i>border</i> on the <i>sheet</i> will be wiped out, which
is another mechanism to clean the outer <i>sheet</i> boundary from unwanted
pixels. <br>
<br>
Second, a detected <i>border</i> can optionally be aligned towards one edge of
the <i>sheet</i>. <b><i>Border-aligning</i></b> means shifting the area
inside the <i>border</i> towards one edge of the <i>sheet</i>.
The edge towards which to shift the border is specified with the
option <b><tt>--border-align</tt></b>.
Additionally, a fixed distance from the edge is
kept, which can be set via <b><tt>--border-margin</tt></b>.
<br>
This way, it can be assured that e.g. all <i>pages</i> of a scanned
book regularly start 2 cm below the upper <i>sheet</i> edge.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/border-align.png"><br>
<small>Figure 12: Border-Aligning</small><br>
<br>
Note that <i>border-aligning</i> is not performed by default, it needs
to be explicitly activated by setting the option <tt>--border-align</tt> to
one of the edge names <tt>top</tt>, <tt>bottom</tt>, <tt>left</tt>
or <tt>right</tt>, and by setting <tt>--border-margin</tt> to the
desired distance which is to be kept to this edge.<br>
<br>
Use <b><tt>--no-border-scan </tt></b>to disable <i>border-detection</i>,
or <b><tt>--no-border-align</tt></b>
to prevent <i>border-aligning</i> on specific <i>sheets</i>, both
optionally followed by
the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filters for.

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="sizevalues"></a>Size Values<br></h3>

Whenever an option expects a <b><i>size</i></b> value, there are three
possible ways to specify that:<br>
<ul>
  <li>as absolute pixel values, e.g. <tt>--sheet-size 4000,3000</tt></li>
  <li>as length measurements on one of the scales <tt>cm</tt>, <tt>mm</tt>,
    <tt>in</tt>, e.g. <tt>--size 30cm,20cm</tt> or also <tt>--size
10in,250mm<br>
    </tt></li>
  <li>using one of the following <i>size</i> names:&nbsp;</li>

Using one of the last two ways, length measurements get internally
converted to absolute pixel values based on the resolution set via
the option <b><tt>--dpi</tt></b>. If the default of 300 DPI should be
changed, this option must appear on the command line before
using a length measurement value. <tt>--dpi</tt> may also appear
multiple times, e.g. if the <i>size</i> values of the output image(s)
should be based on a different resolution than those of the input file(s).<br>
<br>
Note that using the <tt>--dpi</tt> option will have no effect on the
resolution of the <i>image-files</i> that get written as output. (The PNM format is not
capable of storing information about the image resolution.) The value
set via <tt>--dpi</tt> will only have effect on <tt>unpaper</tt>'s internal conversion of
length measurements to absolute pixel values when <i>size</i> values are specified using
length measurements or <i>size</i> names.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="blackfilter"></a>Blackfilter</h3>

Sometimes it is desirable to automatically remove large black areas
which originate from bad photocopies or other optical influences. The <b><i>blackfilter</i></b>
can help to find large areas of black and wipe them out automatically.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/blackfilter.png"><br>
<small>Figure 13: Blackfilter</small><br>
<br>
Be careful with pictures in scanned documents, especially
with diagrams. Some diagrams intentionally contain large areas of dark
color, which might be affected by automatic wipe-out of the
<i>blackfilter</i>. In order to prevent actual <i>page</i> content
from being wiped out, the option <b><tt>--blackfilter-scan-exclude</tt></b>
allows to specify areas on the <i>sheet</i> which should not be taken
into account by the <i>blackfilter</i>. When using one of the default <i>layout
templates</i> set via the <b><tt>--layout</tt></b>
option, the inner area of each <i>page</i> will automatically be
excluded from black-filtering.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/blackfilter-detail.png"><br>
<small>Figure 14: Blackfilter Details</small><br>
<br>
The <i>blackfilter</i> can be disabled by the option <b><tt>--no-blackfilter</tt></b>,
optionally followed by the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter
for.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="noisefilter"></a>Noisefilter</h3>

The <b><i>noisefilter</i></b> removes small clusters of pixels
("noise") from the <i>sheet</i>.<br>
The maximum pixel-size of clusters to be removed can be set via <b><tt>--noisefilter-intensity</tt></b>.
This value must not be chosen too high in order not to remove relevant
elements of <i>page</i> content, e.g. normal text-points ("."). As a
consequence, this option might have to be adjusted on images with a low
scan resolution.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/noisefilter.png"><br>
<small>Figure 15: Noisefilter</small><br>
<br>
Disable with <b><tt>--no-noisefilter</tt></b>, optionally followed by
the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter for.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="blurfilter"></a>Blurfilter</h3>

The <b><i>blurfilter</i></b> removes "lonely" clusters of pixels, i.e.
clusters which have only very few other dark pixels in their neighborhood.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/blurfilter.png"><br>
<small>Figure 16: Blurfilter</small><br>
<br>
The size of the neighborhood to be searched and the amount of other dark
pixels accepted in the neighborhood below which the area gets wiped out
can be adjusted with the options <b><tt>--blurfilter-size</tt></b>,
<b><tt>--blurfilter-step</tt></b> and <b><tt>--blurfilter-intensity</tt></b>.
Additionally, <tt>--blurfilter-step</tt> also determines the step-size
with which the neighborhood-area is moved across the image while filtering.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/blurfilter-detail.png"><br>
<small>Figure 17: Blurfilter Details</small><br>
<br>
Disable with <b><tt>--no-blurfilter</tt></b>, optionally followed by
the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter for.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="grayfilter"></a>Grayfilter</h3>

The <b><i>grayfilter</i></b> removes areas which are gray-only, that
means it wipes
out all those areas which do not contain a maximum relative amount of
non-dark pixels. The size of the local area the
<i>grayfilter</i> operates on can be set using <b><tt>--grayfilter-size</tt></b>,
and the granularity of detection is controlled via <b><tt>--grayfiter-step</tt></b>.
The maximum relative amount of non-dark pixels that are still
considered to be deletable can be set using <b><tt>--grayfilter-threshold</tt></b>.<br>
<br>
Be careful with the <i>grayfilter</i> when processing color scans,
because any bright color might be considered as gray and be wiped out. It might be a good
idea to disable the <i>grayfilter</i> when processing color scans.<br>
<br>
Disable with <b><tt>--no-grayfilter</tt></b>, optionally followed by
the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable the filter for.<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="deskewing"></a>Deskewing (Auto-Straightening)</h3>

The <i>deskewing</i> performed by <tt>unpaper</tt> is actually a
rotation to automatically straighten rectangular content areas on the <i>sheet</i>.
It is applied to any <i>mask</i> that has been found during <i>mask-detection</i>
or that has been set directly via the <tt>--mask</tt> option.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/deskew.png"><br>
<small>Figure 18: Deskewing</small><br>
<br>
The algorithm that detects the angle of skew works
better the more regular and solid the edges of the area's content are.<br>
It works as follows:<br>
A 'virtual line' is moved from the outside of one edge inside the
rectangular area. This happens several times, gradually changing the
rotation of the 'virtual line'. (Called 'virtual', because there is of
course no visible line drawn in the image.) The algorithm will count
the number of dark pixels along the line as it is virtually moved.<br>
<br>
Some parameters control the the size of the 'virtual line' and its
movement:<br>
<b><tt>--deskew-scan-size</tt></b>: the height/width of the 'virtual
line' used for scanning (the length of the line at rotation angle 0)<br>
<b><tt>--deskew-scan-range</tt></b>: the absolute value of degrees
between the negative and positive value of which the line will be
rotated (i.e., the default value 5.0 will cause the 'virtual line' to
be rotated in several small steps between -5.0 degrees and 5.0 degrees).<br>
<b><tt>--deskew-scan-step</tt></b>: the step size with which to iterate
between the bounds set by <tt>--deskew-scan-range</tt> (I.e., a value
of 0.1 will lead to the virtual line being successively rotated with
0.0, 0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.3, -0.3 ... degrees.)<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/deskew-detail1.png"><br>
<small>Figure 19: Rotation Detection</small><br>
<br>
At each of these rotation steps, the following is done:
The rotated 'virtual line' gets moved (again 'moved virtually') towards
the center of the rectangular area on which detection gets performed.
Movement is performed pixel by pixel, it starts with the line
completely outside the rectangular area, not yet reaching inside the
area. At each movement-step, the number of dark pixels covered by the
virtual line is counted and is accumulated as the total sum of dark
pixels. For each rotation angle at which this is done, the maximum
difference in the accumulated sum of dark pixels occurring between a
previous movement-step and the next one gets calculated. The rotation
angle for which this maximum difference becomes maximal will be the rotation
angle detected for <i>deskewing</i>.<br>
<br>
The relative amount of dark pixels to accumulate before shifting the 'virtual line' is stopped (and
continued with the next rotation-step) is given by <b><tt>--deskew-scan-depth</tt></b>.
This value is relative to the number of pixels that the 'virtual line' covers in total, i.e.
for the default deskew-scan-size of 1500 and the default deskew-scan-depth
of 0.66, shifting at each rotation step stops after 1000 dark pixels
have been counted in sum (or, if not enough pixels are met, when the
'virtual line' has reached the center of the rectangular area).<br>
<br>
Sometimes, trying out different deskew-scan-depth values, either lower
than the default of 0.66, or higher, can noticeably increase
detection quality. Which value is best is merely coincidental,
depending on the shape of the outer edges of each very first character
in each line of a text area.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="img/deskew-detail2.png"><br>
<small>Figure 20: Rotation Detection Details</small><br>
<br>
The above described the detection process starting at one single edge
of a 4-edged rectangular area (e.g. the left edge, as displayed in the above image).
However, the overall rotation angle detection uses results of up to all
four edges. Which edges to use can be specified by <b><tt>--deskew-scan-direction</tt></b>.
The final rotation angle will then be the average value of all rotation
angles detected at each edge. Usually, the individually detected values
can be expected to be almost the same at each edge, if the rectangular
area to be deskewed has a regular shape. If, however,
the individual values differ too much, it can be concluded that
something went wrong with the detection, and no <i>deskewing</i>
should be performed. (E.g., if the
rotation at the left edge appears to be -0.5 degrees, but at the right
edge results in 1.9 degrees, one should better not use the average value,
because with that big difference something seems to have gone wrong with the
detection.)
So, before using the average of all individually detected values, their
statistical standard-deviation is calculated, which is <img class="inline" alt="squareroot((a-average)^2 + (b-average)^2 + ...)" src="img/standard-deviation.png" align="top">.
If the standard-deviation among the detected angles exceeds the value
specified by <b><tt>--deskew-scan-deviation</tt></b>, the total result
is considered to be wrong and no <i>deskewing</i> is
performed.<br>
<br>
<i>Deskewing</i> can be disabled with <b><tt>--no-deskew</tt></b>,
optionally followed by the <i>sheet</i> numbers to disable it for.<br>


<h2><a name="processingorder"></a>Processing Order</h2>

Processing of the filters and auto-corrections is performed in a fixed

<h4><span class="mozTocH4"></span>Disabling processing steps</h4>
Each processing step can be disabled individually by
a corresponding <b><tt>--no-xxx</tt></b> option (where <tt>xxx</tt>
stands for the feature to disable, e.g. <tt>--no-grayfilter</tt>, <tt>--no-mask-scan</tt>
etc.).<br>
If such an option is followed by a <i>sheet</i> number, or a comma-seperated list
of multiple <i>sheet</i> numbers, the filter gets disabled only for those <i>sheets</i>
specified. Otherwise (if no <i>sheet</i> number follows), the filter is
disabled for all <i>sheets</i>. Instead of specifying individual <i>sheet</i>
numbers, also a range of numbers can be given, e.g. "10-20" to represent all
<i>sheet</i> numbers between 10 and 20. Example:<br>
<br>
<tt>unpaper (...options...) --no-blackfilter 3,15,21-28,40 (...)<br></tt><br>
This will disable the <i>blackfilter</i> on the <i>sheets</i> 3, 15,
21, 22, 23, etc. until 28, and 40.<br>
